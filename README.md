# Fall 2018 DS4100 Final Project

This project attempts to explore crime statistic data published yearly by the NYPD.  See the attached .rmd file for the full report, but, in summary, it attempts to answer the following questions:

- Is there a borough that contains a higher perctage of a specific crime?

- What is the spread of gender of the victims and suspects?

- Is crime more likely to occur during the day or at night?

- Can the time that it takes for a victim to report a crime be predicted based on specific variables?

- Can crime statistics be forecasted?
